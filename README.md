# Starr_Rose: Liam Hillery
### UI:
Upon loading the program in Processing, you will be given the ability to edit the rose paramaters ("a" is for # of points, "b"&"c" change the general shape of the rose.) After that are the inner and outer colors, which allow for a gradient from the inside to the outside of the rose. Set it to #000000 to fade it out of existance. The "Save" button saves the image as a vector-point PDF.
